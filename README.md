# Reseau Hybride

Hybrid routing protocol for wireless mesh network based on [babeld protocol](https://github.com/jech/babeld).

## Getting start

## Environment

To run the protocol, you can use a physical network environment or you can use [Nemu](https://gitlab.com/v-a/nemu/). 
> Nemu is a distributed virtual network environment which fully runs without any administrative rights. It manages fleet of QEMU VMs in order to build a dynamic virtual topology. It provides self-script (launcher and interpreter) and a python API to create and manage heterogeneous, dynamic, distributed, collaborative and mobile virtual networks. 
To install it, follow this [link](https://gitlab.com/v-a/nemu/wikis/tuto/install/debian).

### Setting up Nemu environment
